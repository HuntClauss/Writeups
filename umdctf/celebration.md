From ctf we have got image called celebration.png
<img alt="Flag encrypted with Dancing Men Cipher" src="https://umdctf.io/files/5b5236fe2ae3e28d346025a685b82c4a/celebration.png?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjozNzYsInRlYW1faWQiOjE3MywiZmlsZV9pZCI6OTV9.YILM6Q.HRoM1vHKudA__otg481P3Fp9SNk" />

From other ctf I know that this is funny cipher that is just a regular substitution cipher witch use images of dancing sticky guys.
After quick search I found [website](https://www.dcode.fr/dancing-men-cipher) that allowed me to decode this.
