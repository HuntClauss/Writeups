# Testudo's Pizza | Steganography

### Solution

From ctf we have got image called hiddenmsg.jpg

To solve this, all you have to do was to open a file with text editor
```bash
$ strings hiddenmsg.jpg
[lots of junk]
```

This command gave me a lot of binary garbage but at the end of file was flag in plaintext.

### Flag
