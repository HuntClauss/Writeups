# The Matrix | Web

### Solution

From ctf we have got website.

Only interesting thing on website was **/the-matrix** subpage that redirects to **/403** where we could see this message
`This page is for robots only, you are not allowed to access this content!`

This message gave me a hint that with *Google Bot User Agent* I should be able to see the real content of **/the-matrix** page
```bash
$ curl -A 'Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Googlebot/2.1; +http://www.google.com/bot.html)' http://chals5.umdctf.io:4000/the-matrix
```

Using this command ends up with a flag
